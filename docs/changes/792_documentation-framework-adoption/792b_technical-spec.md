# Documentation Framework Adoption - Technical Spec

## 792b1 Orientation

- **Product problem:** [`792a1`](./792a_product-spec.md#792a1-problem-statement). Engram's shipped
  behavior has no specifications in the framework's format, and its tests can't be traced to any
  specification.
- **Current behavior:** The system already exists and is unchanged by this change. Its technical
  contracts are described only by the legacy C4 views, the ADRs, the invariants document, and the
  technical parts of the OpenSpec specs.
- **Insufficiency:** Those sources do not follow the framework's component qualification, ID, or
  product-traceability rules.
- **Recommended solution:** Document each qualifying component of the existing system as one
  **Added** component section. Map each section to the product scenarios it supports, and rename the
  existing tests that verify its scenarios.

This change describes the existing system and selects no new design. Its technical sections
therefore omit the guide's recommended-impact, relative-option-impact, and alternative-options
sections, because no options are being compared. They also omit component diffs: every component is
retained and documented as Added. Each component section instead uses the per-component structure in
[`792c3`](./792c_implementation-plan.md#792c3-spec-section-templates): orientation, sequences,
behavior requirements with Gherkin, and product-scenario mapping. Rationale appears under the
requirement or orientation it justifies.

Component sections `792b2` through `792b39` are added by the nodes of
[`792c_implementation-plan.md`](./792c_implementation-plan.md).
