## ISSUE-001: Implement deterministic orchestrator (projctl orchestrate)

**Priority:** Medium-term
**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-01

### Summary

Replace LLM-driven orchestration with a deterministic outer loop that invokes the LLM only for skill work. This eliminates context pollution as the root cause of orchestrator reliability issues.

### Problem

The current `/project` skill has the LLM manage the entire control loop:
1. Read state
2. Transition state
3. Generate territory map
4. Write context
5. **Do skill work** (only this needs LLM)
6. Read result
7. Check next action
8. Loop

Steps 1-4 and 6-8 are deterministic - they don't require reasoning. But because the LLM handles them, its context fills with code diffs, debug output, file contents, and previous iterations.

This causes control loop instructions to degrade in attention, leading to:
- Forgetting to call state transitions
- Claiming tasks complete when AC aren't met
- Stopping prematurely
- Going off-rails entirely

### Proposed Solution

Implement `projctl orchestrate` as a non-LLM program:

```bash
projctl orchestrate --dir . --task TASK-XXX
```

Internally:
```
while true:
    state = projctl state get --format json
    projctl state transition $next_phase
    projctl map --cached
    projctl context write --task $task --skill $skill

    # ONLY invoke LLM here
    claude --skill $skill --context context/$task-$skill.toml

    projctl context read --result
    next = projctl state next --format json

    if next.action == "stop":
        break
```

The LLM never sees orchestration machinery - it receives context, does work, writes result. Cannot forget control loop because it never knew it.

### Benefits

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Reliability | Deterministic code can't forget instructions |
| Efficiency | LLM only invoked for actual reasoning tasks |
| Debuggability | Shell script/Go code is inspectable |
| Testability | Control loop can be unit tested without LLM |

### Implementation Considerations

- May need `claude` CLI or API access for sub-agent invocation
- Could use Claude Code's Task tool initially, migrate to direct API later
- Session management for multi-task orchestration
- Error handling and recovery flows

### Relationship to Other Work

This is the "medium-term" solution. Short-term mitigations (TASK-060 through TASK-062) make the LLM-based orchestrator thinner, but this issue represents the architectural fix.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `projctl orchestrate` command implemented
- [ ] Deterministic loop handles all `[D]` steps from control loop
- [ ] LLM invoked only for skill dispatch
- [ ] State preserved entirely in files (state.toml, context/, result.toml)
- [ ] Works with existing skills without modification
- [ ] Error recovery via state.toml (can resume after crash)

**Traces to:** Phase 12 (Relentless Continuation)

## ISSUE-002: TDD for documentation tasks

**Priority:** Medium-term
**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2026-02-01

### Summary

Documentation tasks should follow TDD discipline just like code tasks. Documentation is a feature - the same rigor should apply.

### Problem

Currently, documentation tasks (like updating SKILL.md files) are treated as "just edits" without the same TDD discipline applied to code:
- No failing test first
- No validation that the documentation achieves its purpose
- No structured review of whether the changes fit the overall document structure

This leads to:
- Documentation drift from actual behavior
- Inconsistent structure across documents
- Missing or redundant sections
- No regression detection when docs change

### Proposed Approach

Apply TDD to documentation:

1. **Red phase (what should docs say?):**
   - Write a test/validation that checks for expected content
   - Could be: grep patterns, section presence, word count limits
   - Could be: consistency checks against other docs
   - Test fails because content doesn't exist yet

2. **Green phase (do they say it?):**
   - Write the documentation to make tests pass
   - Minimal content to satisfy the requirements

3. **Refactor phase (does it fit?):**
   - Review structure in context of full document
   - Check for redundancy with other sections
   - Verify it doesn't break other "doc tests"

### Implementation Considerations

- `projctl docs validate` command to check documentation structure
- Schema for expected sections in skill files
- Linting rules for documentation consistency
- Integration with trace validate for doc-to-code traceability

### Questions to Resolve

- What tooling exists for "testing" markdown?
- How to define expected structure without over-constraining?
- How to handle doc tests that are inherently subjective (readability)?
- Should doc tests be code tests or a separate validation pass?

### Relationship to Other Work

- Affects all documentation-related tasks
- Should be incorporated into skill definitions (what makes a "valid" skill doc?)
- May need updates to task-audit to include doc validation

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document what "TDD for docs" means in practice
- [ ] Update relevant skills to include doc validation
- [ ] Create `projctl docs validate` or similar tooling
- [ ] Apply to existing skill SKILL.md files as proof of concept

**Traces to:** Process improvement
