# Vault Identity - Product Spec

Every engram command that reads or writes notes works against one vault: a directory of Markdown
notes on the local filesystem. This capability covers where that vault is, how it comes into
existence, and the stable identity that keeps a copied, cloned or self-parented vault from
exchanging notes under another vault's name. The chunk-only commands `prune`, `query-chunks` and
`show-chunk` resolve no vault. Exchange with a parent vault itself is the parent-sync capability ([parent-sync](./parent-sync.md)).

## 792a2a Vault location

Requirement: [792a2a Vault location](#792a2a-vault-location) Engram MUST use, as the vault path, the first of these that is set: the
`--vault` flag, the `ENGRAM_VAULT_PATH` environment variable, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/engram/vault`, and
`~/.local/share/engram/vault`. `engram update` defines no `--vault` flag and rejects one, so it
takes its vault from the last three only.

### 792a2a1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2a1a The flag wins over the environment
  Given ENGRAM_VAULT_PATH is set to /env/vault
  When the user runs an engram command with --vault /flag/vault
  Then the command uses /flag/vault

Scenario: 792a2a1b The environment variable is used without a flag
  Given ENGRAM_VAULT_PATH is set to /env/vault
  When the user runs an engram command without --vault
  Then the command uses /env/vault

Scenario: 792a2a1c The XDG data directory is the default
  Given neither --vault nor ENGRAM_VAULT_PATH is set and XDG_DATA_HOME is /data
  When the user runs an engram command
  Then the command uses /data/engram/vault

Scenario: 792a2a1d The home directory is the last fallback
  Given neither --vault, ENGRAM_VAULT_PATH nor XDG_DATA_HOME is set
  When the user runs an engram command
  Then the command uses ~/.local/share/engram/vault
```

## 792a2b Vault name

Requirement: [792a2b Vault name](#792a2b-vault-name) Engram MUST record a vault name in the `vault:` field of every note it writes,
taken from the first of these that is set: the `--vault-name` flag, the `ENGRAM_VAULT_NAME`
environment variable, and the default `personal`.

### 792a2b1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2b1a The default vault name is personal
  Given neither --vault-name nor ENGRAM_VAULT_NAME is set
  When the user writes a note with engram learn
  Then the note's vault: field is personal

Scenario: 792a2b1b The environment names the vault
  Given ENGRAM_VAULT_NAME is set to team
  When the user writes a note with engram learn without --vault-name
  Then the note's vault: field is team

Scenario: 792a2b1c The flag wins over the environment
  Given ENGRAM_VAULT_NAME is set to team
  When the user writes a note with engram learn --vault-name org
  Then the note's vault: field is org
```

## 792a2c Flat vault layout

Requirement: [792a2c Flat vault layout](#792a2c-flat-vault-layout) Engram MUST NOT treat a file inside a vault subdirectory as a note; notes live
at the vault root.

Rationale: the vault is flat, with no `Permanent/` or `MOCs/` tiers, so a note's place in the vault is carried by its
Luhmann ID, not by a folder.

### 792a2c1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2c1a A Markdown file in a subdirectory is not a note
  Given a vault with one note at its root and one Markdown file in a subdirectory
  When the user runs engram embed status on the vault
  Then it reports a total of 1 note
```

## 792a2d Starter README

Requirement: [792a2d Starter README](#792a2d-starter-readme) Engram MUST NOT treat the untouched starter `README.md` it writes into a new
vault as a note, and MUST treat any other root `README.md` as a note.

Rationale: a freshly created vault must report itself clean; the starter README is recognized by
its exact content, so a user's own README, or an edited starter, stays a normal note.

### 792a2d1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2d1a A fresh vault has no notes
  Given a vault that engram has just created
  When the user runs engram embed status and engram check on it
  Then embed status reports a total of 0 notes and check reports no note missing a sidecar

Scenario: 792a2d1b A user's README is a note
  Given a vault whose README.md the user has replaced with their own text
  When the user runs engram embed status and engram check on it
  Then embed status reports a total of 1 note and check reports 1 note missing a sidecar
```

## 792a2e First-use vault creation

Requirement: [792a2e First-use vault creation](#792a2e-first-use-vault-creation) Every command that resolves a vault path MUST, when no vault exists at that
path, create one before the command runs, whether or not `ENGRAM_PARENT` is set, and print exactly
one stderr line, `engram: created new vault at <path>`. The new vault contains `.obsidian/app.json`,
a `.gitignore`, a starter `README.md`, a vault ID ([792a2h Stable vault ID](#792a2h-stable-vault-id)) and the `.engram/` state directory
([792a2k Exchange state outside tracked files](#792a2k-exchange-state-outside-tracked-files)).

Rationale: any command creates a missing vault, and the single stderr line makes a mistyped `--vault` or
`ENGRAM_VAULT_PATH` visible. The `.obsidian/` starter lets Obsidian open the directory as a vault.

### 792a2e1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2e1a A read command creates the vault
  Given no vault exists at the resolved path
  When the user runs engram query --phrase x
  Then an initialized vault exists at that path, stderr carries one line naming it, and the query returns an empty result without error

Scenario: 792a2e1b amend and activate fail only on their own merits
  Given no vault exists at the resolved path
  When the user runs engram amend or engram activate on a target that does not exist
  Then the vault is created first, and the command fails because the target is not found, never on a vault lock error

Scenario: 792a2e1c A child host gets its own vault
  Given a host with ENGRAM_PARENT set and no vault at its resolved local path
  When the user runs engram query for the first time
  Then a local vault is created at the resolved local path, separate from the parent's vault

Scenario: 792a2e1d A second run creates nothing
  Given a vault that an engram command has just created
  When the user runs the same command again
  Then no creation line is printed and the vault ID is unchanged
```

## 792a2f Existing vaults are left alone

Requirement: [792a2f Existing vaults are left alone](#792a2f-existing-vaults-are-left-alone) A command MUST NOT create or modify any file, or print the creation line, when it
runs read-only against an existing vault while no parent is configured.

Rationale: `.engram-vault-id` is tracked, so stamping it on read-only use would dirty a git-backed
vault on every host that merely reads it.

### 792a2f1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2f1a An existing vault is untouched by read-only use
  Given an existing vault with no vault ID and no parent configured
  When the user runs a read-only command against it
  Then no vault file is created or modified, and no creation line is printed
```

## 792a2g Interrupted creation is repaired

Requirement: [792a2g Interrupted creation is repaired](#792a2g-interrupted-creation-is-repaired) When a vault has the `.engram/` state directory but no vault ID, because its
first-use creation stopped part-way, the next command that resolves it MUST give it a vault ID and
print exactly one stderr line, `engram: stamped the missing vault ID of <path>`.

Rationale: creation writes `.engram/` before the ID, so `.engram/` marks a vault engram created,
and a pre-existing vault with neither stays untouched ([792a2f Existing vaults are left alone](#792a2f-existing-vaults-are-left-alone)).

### 792a2g1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2g1a A half-created vault gets its ID
  Given a vault with a .engram/ directory and no .engram-vault-id
  When the user runs any vault-resolving command
  Then .engram-vault-id is created and stderr carries one line saying the missing vault ID was stamped
```

## 792a2h Stable vault ID

Requirement: [792a2h Stable vault ID](#792a2h-stable-vault-id) Every vault MUST have a random vault ID of 32 lowercase hex characters in the
tracked file `<vault>/.engram-vault-id`. A new vault gets it when it is created. An existing vault
without one gets it only when `engram serve` starts on it, when a command with a parent configured
first writes exchange state in it (contacting the parent, queueing an offer or recording a declined
pull), or through `engram vault-id --regenerate`. The ID changes only through `engram vault-id --regenerate`.

Rationale: links to a parent's notes are keyed by the parent's vault ID, never by URL, so a hostname
or IP change breaks nothing. Lazy stamping keeps read-only use of an existing vault from creating a
tracked file ([792a2f Existing vaults are left alone](#792a2f-existing-vaults-are-left-alone)).

### 792a2h1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2h1a serve stamps an existing vault
  Given an existing vault that has no .engram-vault-id
  When engram serve starts on it
  Then the file is created with a new ID, and later starts reuse it unchanged

Scenario: 792a2h1b The first parent contact stamps an existing vault
  Given an existing vault that has no .engram-vault-id and ENGRAM_PARENT set
  When the user runs engram query
  Then .engram-vault-id is created and no location warning is printed

Scenario: 792a2h1c Concurrent creation converges
  Given an existing vault that has no .engram-vault-id
  When two processes create the ID for it at the same moment
  Then exactly one file is written, and both processes use its ID
```

## 792a2i Uncommitted vault ID notice

Requirement: [792a2i Uncommitted vault ID notice](#792a2i-uncommitted-vault-id-notice) `engram update` MUST print a notice asking for a one-time vault commit while
`.engram-vault-id` exists in a git-backed vault and is untracked, ignored, staged, or modified
relative to the last commit, and MUST print no such notice otherwise.

Rationale: the ID file's first creation in an existing git-backed vault is a deliberate one-time
commit (`vault: add vault id`).

### 792a2i1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2i1a Uncommitted ID is flagged
  Given a git-backed vault whose .engram-vault-id is untracked
  When the user runs engram update
  Then its report includes a notice asking for a one-time vault commit

Scenario: 792a2i1b An ignored ID is flagged
  Given a git-backed vault whose .engram-vault-id is ignored by its .gitignore
  When the user runs engram update
  Then its report includes the commit notice

Scenario: 792a2i1c A committed ID is not flagged
  Given a git-backed vault whose .engram-vault-id is committed and unmodified
  When the user runs engram update
  Then its report includes no commit notice

Scenario: 792a2i1d A vault outside git is not flagged
  Given a vault that is not a git work tree and has a .engram-vault-id
  When the user runs engram update
  Then its report includes no commit notice
```

## 792a2j Corrupt vault ID

Requirement: [792a2j Corrupt vault ID](#792a2j-corrupt-vault-id) When `.engram-vault-id` is empty or does not hold 32 lowercase hex characters,
engram MUST report it as invalid with a message naming `engram vault-id --regenerate`, and MUST
leave the file unchanged. `engram serve` still starts, and a merged query still returns its local
results.

Rationale: a partial write or a git conflict can corrupt the file; refusing to serve would turn it
into a host outage.

### 792a2j1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2j1a serve starts despite a corrupt ID
  Given a vault whose .engram-vault-id is empty or holds a git conflict marker
  When engram serve starts on it
  Then it warns naming engram vault-id --regenerate, serves, and leaves the file unchanged

Scenario: 792a2j1b A merged query warns and still runs
  Given a vault whose .engram-vault-id holds junk and ENGRAM_PARENT set
  When the user runs engram query
  Then stderr says the vault ID could not be stamped and names engram vault-id --regenerate, and the local results are returned

Scenario: 792a2j1c vault-id reports the corrupt file
  Given a vault whose .engram-vault-id holds junk
  When the user runs engram vault-id
  Then it fails with an error saying the vault ID is invalid
```

## 792a2k Exchange state outside tracked files

Requirement: [792a2k Exchange state outside tracked files](#792a2k-exchange-state-outside-tracked-files) Engram MUST keep transient exchange state in `<vault>/.engram/`, whose own
`.gitignore` holds only the pattern `*`, and MUST NOT write exchange state to the vault root or
modify the vault's root `.gitignore`.

Rationale: the outbox lives under `<vault>/.engram/`, which is untracked, so it never dirties the vault's repository
on any host, and it travels with the vault when the vault moves.

### 792a2k1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2k1a State does not dirty the vault's git
  Given a git-backed vault
  When an offer is queued in it
  Then git status --porcelain in the vault shows no change caused by exchange state

Scenario: 792a2k1b The root .gitignore is untouched
  Given an existing vault with its own root .gitignore
  When engram stamps the vault's ID and creates .engram/
  Then the root .gitignore is byte-for-byte unchanged
```

## 792a2l Inspecting the vault ID

Requirement: [792a2l Inspecting the vault ID](#792a2l-inspecting-the-vault-id) `engram vault-id` with no flag MUST print the vault ID, or `none`, and the
location check result (`ok`, `missing`, `mismatch` or `no vault id`), MUST also print a remedy line
naming `engram vault-id --regenerate` and `engram vault-id --claim` when the check is `missing` or
`mismatch`, and MUST write nothing.

### 792a2l1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2l1a A healthy vault reports its ID
  Given a vault that engram created at its current path
  When the user runs engram vault-id
  Then stdout shows its vault ID and location: ok, and stderr is empty

Scenario: 792a2l1b A moved vault reports a mismatch with both remedies
  Given a vault that was moved after engram created it
  When the user runs engram vault-id
  Then stdout shows location: mismatch and names both engram vault-id --claim and engram vault-id --regenerate

Scenario: 792a2l1c A vault without an ID is reported without writing
  Given an existing vault with no vault ID
  When the user runs engram vault-id
  Then stdout shows location: no vault id, and no file in the vault is created or changed
```

## 792a2m Regenerating the vault ID

Requirement: [792a2m Regenerating the vault ID](#792a2m-regenerating-the-vault-id) `engram vault-id --regenerate` MUST give the vault a new vault ID, record the
vault's current location for it, and change no note.

Rationale: this is the remedy for a copy. Links point at parent vault IDs and stay valid, and
queued offers carry the new origin ID when they are sent.

### 792a2m1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2m1a Regenerate gives a copy its own identity
  Given a copied vault
  When the user runs engram vault-id --regenerate in it
  Then its ID differs from the original's, exchange resumes, and no note file changed
```

## 792a2n Claiming a moved vault

Requirement: [792a2n Claiming a moved vault](#792a2n-claiming-a-moved-vault) `engram vault-id --claim` MUST record the vault's current location for its
existing vault ID without changing the ID, and MUST fail when the vault has no vault ID.

Rationale: this is the remedy for the same vault moved or re-cloned.

### 792a2n1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2n1a Claim accepts a moved vault
  Given a vault that was moved to a new path
  When the user runs engram vault-id --claim
  Then the ID is unchanged, engram vault-id then reports location: ok, and exchange resumes

Scenario: 792a2n1b Claim needs an ID
  Given an existing vault with no vault ID
  When the user runs engram vault-id --claim
  Then it fails with an error saying the vault has no vault ID
```

## 792a2o Regenerate and claim are exclusive

Requirement: [792a2o Regenerate and claim are exclusive](#792a2o-regenerate-and-claim-are-exclusive) `engram vault-id` MUST refuse `--regenerate` and `--claim` together and leave
the vault ID unchanged.

### 792a2o1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2o1a Both flags are refused
  Given a vault with a vault ID
  When the user runs engram vault-id --regenerate --claim
  Then it fails naming --regenerate, and the vault ID is unchanged
```

## 792a2p Copied and cloned vaults pause exchange

Requirement: [792a2p Copied and cloned vaults pause exchange](#792a2p-copied-and-cloned-vaults-pause-exchange) Before sending an offer or pulling a note down, a command MUST check that the
vault's location record matches its current vault ID and canonical path. When the record is missing
(a fresh `git clone`) or differs (a `cp -R` or a move), the command sends no offer and pulls nothing
down, still writes locally and queues offers, and prints exactly one warning naming both
`engram vault-id --regenerate` and `engram vault-id --claim`. A merged query still runs, with the
same warning, and `engram serve` prints the same warning and starts anyway.

Rationale: the check catches two children sharing an ID, one cloned from the other, at the clone's
first exchange, before any offer carries a shared origin. `.engram/` is untracked, so a clone has no
record, while a copy or a move has one for another path. `engram serve` warns rather than refusing,
because refusing would turn a false positive into a host outage: launchd restarts it, it refuses
again, children back off, and offers pile up. The record holds no hostname, because DHCP, `.local`
renames and containers change hostnames without the vault moving.

### 792a2p1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2p1a A cloned child is caught before it offers
  Given vault A is cloned with git to a new host with ENGRAM_PARENT set
  When the clone runs engram learn
  Then the note is written locally and queued, no offer is sent, and the warning names both engram vault-id remedies

Scenario: 792a2p1b A cloned child's merged query still runs
  Given a vault with ENGRAM_PARENT set whose location record is missing
  When the user runs engram query
  Then the query returns its results, and stderr carries one warning naming both engram vault-id remedies

Scenario: 792a2p1c serve starts despite a mismatched record
  Given a vault whose location record is missing or differs
  When engram serve starts on it
  Then it prints the warning and serves normally

Scenario: 792a2p1d A symlinked path is not a false positive
  Given a vault reached through a symlink to its recorded path
  When the location check runs
  Then the check passes

Scenario: 792a2p1e A hostname change is not a false positive
  Given a host whose name changed while the vault path did not
  When the location check runs
  Then the check passes
```

## 792a2q A vault does not exchange with itself

Requirement: [792a2q A vault does not exchange with itself](#792a2q-a-vault-does-not-exchange-with-itself) A vault MUST NOT act as its own parent. When a parent reports the same vault ID as
the local vault, a command MUST NOT merge, pull down, send or queue any offer, and MUST otherwise behave as if no parent
were configured, so a read command still works, apart from printing exactly one warning naming
`engram vault-id --regenerate`.

Rationale: a child cloned from its parent whose location record was copied too, at a matching path,
passes the location check ([792a2p Copied and cloned vaults pause exchange](#792a2p-copied-and-cloned-vaults-pause-exchange)); this guard catches it instead. A vault that is its own parent has nothing to
exchange with, so a write made in it queues no offer; an offer queued before the mistake was detected is left unsent and
not rejected ([792a21y A looping offer is refused](./parent-sync.md#792a21y-a-looping-offer-is-refused)).

### 792a2q1 UAT Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario: 792a2q1a A copied vault served back to itself
  Given a copy of vault V is served and V's environment points ENGRAM_PARENT at it
  When the user runs engram query in V
  Then it returns local-only results with a warning naming engram vault-id --regenerate, and no offer is sent or queued

Scenario: 792a2q1b A write in a vault that is its own parent queues nothing
  Given a vault whose parent reports the vault's own ID
  When the user runs engram learn
  Then the note is written, no offer is queued, nothing is sent, and one warning names engram vault-id --regenerate
```
